# Numerically GID sorted list of groups.  GIDs and names are not sync'ed or
# mirrored in to ops-config in any way.
#
# The primary group for users must be between 10000 and 10999, inclusive, and
# represents a given department that a user belongs to.  Each user can have
# auxilary groups, starting at GID 12000.
#
# Each major department gets 10000 gid's for sub-dividing its departments.
#
# GID range 12000:12999 is reserved for corporate attributes (e.g. employee
# vs contractor, PCI background checked, MFA/2FA enabled, etc).
#
# The various constraints for each group must all evaluate to TRUE.  The
# constraints are put in place in order to ensure compliance and appropriate
# separation of duties.
